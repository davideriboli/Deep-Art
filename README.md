# Deep-Art
_A collection of AI and generative tools for any kinf of digital artists_

This repository collects the best tools I find around.

Much of the content is from other repositories, but since it's impossible to manage them properly as submodules, I just download them when I need them.

For this reason, the various _readme_ always show the date of my last pull. Credits to the authors and links to their original repositories are all listed in the [Wiki](https://github.com/davideriboli/Deep-Art/wiki).
