# Deep-Art
_A collection of AI tools for any kinf of digital artists_

In 2022, I began experimenting with deep learning and artificial intelligence scripts for art production.

This repository collects the best tools I find around.

A lot of the content is added in the form of GitHub submodules. My repository is released under an MIT license, but the submodules may have different licenses.
